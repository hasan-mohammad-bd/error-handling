            <h4>1. How does javascript work?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <span class="fw-bold">Answer: </span> JavaScript is a single threaded client side interpreted programming language, which mainly executed by the browser with the help of interpreted engine like V8 in chrome and also runs in server side with the help of runtime like NODE.js(made with modifying v8 engine). the engine converts the JavaScript code into machine readable language. Then we can see the JS content in our screen. <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context. Execution context is like a big box which has two components. The first component is called memory where all kind of variables and functions are stored as key value pair. This memory component also being called variable environment. The second component of execution context is called code component. Here the code is executed one line at a time. This component also being called thread of execution. As JavaScript is a single-threaded language, when one line is executed completely then the next line is executed.

            <h4>2. What is the different between Local storage and Session storage?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <span class="fw-bold">Answer: </span> Session storage and local storage is almost same. But there are few differences between session storage and local storage. Those are described as below. <br><br>
                Session storage expire when the page reload/close. For example: if a user mute a video sound of a particular website. But after reloading the page, the previously muted video become unmuted. This  kind data was kept in session storage. One the other hand, Local storage can keep the data for long period of time. For example: User shopping card. which can store selected product and won't be removed or expired until the user remove it or buy the product. <br> <br>
                For a particular website, if different pages are open in a browser, URL creates different session storage for different pages. On the other hand, local storage will be same for different pages.
                The session storage only can service until the window or tab is open. But the Local storage will survive until anyone clean the local storage. <br><br>
                Session storage is more secure as session storage store data for short period of time. but the local keep data which in unsecure comparing the session storage.
